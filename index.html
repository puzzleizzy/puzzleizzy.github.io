<h4 id="hox">Theory of Mystery</h4>
<p>Others didn't know that the millionares; Jacob A., Isador S. and Benjamin G; was getting loans from J.P. Morgan and it was a very large investiment that Morgan was terrifed that this case was so big that he has already failed with several other crisis. Morgan was the top finacier, in 1907 NYC, that was cinvinced to bail out carious faltering fincial insitutions in order to stablize the market. As this is loan was boiling over $60 million dept, he also has an large loan for the <i> White Star Line </i> that has been in the works for 4 years now. Nervous that might flop not kill the problem for new buisness. If it did follow through successfully he will get the money back for the damage of the ship. With new buisness to come though with Morgan can put this new investment behind.
<br>
To make it all fall through, Morgan bought tickets for his wife and himself to sail. But during the process Astor and Guggenheim were back and forth on completing the project, but Straus was strongly aposed to completing a brilliant unique dream.
<br>
When coming out with advertisement of the set date, Morgan backed out of his stay on the ship when he found out that the <i> Olympic</i>; The Titanic sister ship; came back in a month with prior to sail date because of numerous hole and damage. That others believered that The Titanic could not survive with so many people, twice other size odf other ships and the damage of the other ships with the same degree. Others believe the driver knew about the area because of <i> Olympics </i>.
